## BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying)
### Description
BPSK is a modulation technique where the phase of the carrier signal switches between two states to represent binary data.

## 8PSK (8-Phase Shift Keying)
### Description
8PSK uses eight distinct phases to represent combinations of 3 bits per symbol, increasing spectral efficiency.

## 16QAM (16-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)
### Description
16QAM combines amplitude and phase to represent 4 bits per symbol, achieving high data efficiency.
